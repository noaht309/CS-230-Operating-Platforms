Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room requested a presentation on the different operating systems they could utilize to port their android game Draw It or Lose It to a web browser. I then explained the different methods they could use to integrate their game into their desired enviornments and the pros and cons of various operating platforms for them to make a decision on. Finally, I made a reccomendation as to which operating system would be best suited for the needs of their game and their situation specifically.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I concisely and clearly explained the various pros and cons associated with each operating system so as to inform The Gaming Room as to which platform would be best suited for their specific needs.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document offered a great pathway from which the logic for actually developing the coding aspects of the project could be done. It served as a good launchpad from which the flow of the entire program could be more easily identified and followed.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Probably in reformatting the way the pros and cons of client and server side as well as developmental tools pros and cons was layed out. I think a simple list would have been more effective in more clearly demonstrating the issues and benefits associated with each repsective operating system and their key funcitonalities. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I made sure to be prescient of the fact that The Gaming Room wanted to include cross-platform compatability into the final reccommendation I made. I also was sure to way the pros and cons as farily and unbiasedly as possible when presenting the various benefits for each OS for client and server side as well as functionalities of developmental tools. It is always important to remember and keep in mind the user's needs when creating a design document since it may afford you advantages during the brainstorming process you may not have considered otherwise. It also helps to ensure that the user will end up with the product they were anticipating and expecting.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
By working through the logical flow of the design of the program first, a solid foundation from which a clear design plan can be made is achieved. Creating a UML diagram to illustrate the logical proceses that underpin the entire functionality of the program really helps in understanding the design requirements of a program from a user's perspective towards the end of the development process.
